Shane Hoang's work on using pneumatic logic to control biomedical devices (like the laboratory blood shaker/rocker shown here) was [published in *Annals of Biomedical Engineering*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10439-024-03628-4)!  Special thanks to our coauthors Mabel Shehada, Konstantinos Karydis, and Philip Brisk.
