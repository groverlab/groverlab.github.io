Junchao Wang's paper "Finding the optimal design of a passive microfluidic mixer" was [published in *Lab on a Chip*](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/lc/c9lc00546c).  Junchao used a genetic algorithm to automatically generate thousands of designs for microfluidic mixers.  The designs reveal a Pareto-optimal limit to mixer design, enabling researchers to readily find optimal mixer designs for a given application.
