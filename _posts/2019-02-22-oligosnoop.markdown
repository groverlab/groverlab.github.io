Did you know you can tell what a lab instrument is doing by listening to it?  We really enjoyed this collaboration with [Prof. Mohammad Al Faruque](http://aicps.eng.uci.edu) at UC Irvine, who showed that you can reconstruct the sequence of DNA being made by a DNA synthesizer by analyzing the sounds made by the machine.  Our paper, ["Oligo-Snoop: A Non-Invasive Side Channel Attack Against DNA Synthesis Machines,"](/assets/oligosnoop.pdf) was presented at the 2019 Network and Distributed Systems Security (NDSS) Symposium in San Diego.
