Did you know you can tell what a lab instrument is doing by listening to it?  We really enjoyed this collaboration with [Prof. Mohammad Al Faruque](http://aicps.eng.uci.edu) at UC Irvine, who showed that you can reconstruct the sequence of DNA being made by a DNA synthesizer by analyzing the sounds made by the machine.  Our paper, ["Oligo-Snoop: A Non-Invasive Side Channel Attack Against DNA Synthesis Machines,"](/assets/oligosnoop.pdf) was presented at the 2019 Network and Distributed Systems Security (NDSS) Symposium in San Diego.

This work was also featured in [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/us/california-today-dna-hacking.html), [Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.com/story/hackers-listen-synthetic-dna-machines/), and [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/ethics/how-to-steal-dna-with-sound).
