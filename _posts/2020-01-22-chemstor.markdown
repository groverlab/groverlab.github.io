*ChemStor* (a collaboration with Jason Ot, Daniel Tan, Tyson Loveless, and Philip Brisk) is the subject of a paper [published in the *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling*](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00951).

*ChemStor* is a software tool that uses principles from *formal methods*---a branch of computer science---to safely store and dispose of chemicals.  Chemical-related accidents in labs and homes are all too common.  In just one example, each year, 4500 injuries are caused by simply mixing incompatible pool chemicals.  *ChemStor* informs the user if two or more chemicals pose a threat if stored or mixed together.  If it is integrated into voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri, *ChemStor* could help keep researchers and the public safe around chemicals.
