Shane Hoang's work on using pneumatic logic to calculate parity bits and detect errors in air-powered systems was [published in *Device*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666998624004071)!  Special thanks to our coauthors Mabel Shehada, Zinal Patel, Minh-Huy Tran, Konstantinos Karydis, and Philip Brisk.
