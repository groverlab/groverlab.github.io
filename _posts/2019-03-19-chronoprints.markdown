Brittney McKenzie's paper "Chronoprints: Identifying samples by visualizing how they change over space and time" was [published in *ACS Central Science*](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00860).  Brittney's "chronological fingerprint" or "chronoprint" technique is basically a way to convert a sample of a substance into a computer image.  By using image comparison algorithms from computer science, we can determine whether two substances are chemically the same or different based on their chronoprints.  Brittney used chronoprints to distinguish authentic and adulterated food products, drugs, and pharmaceutical ingredients.

Thanks to Bioengineering undergraduate researchers Jessica Robles-Najar and Eric Duong and Computer Science and Engineering professor Philip Brisk for their help with this project!
