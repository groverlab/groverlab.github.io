Thanks to the American Chemical Society for [covering our work on musical instruments as sensors](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/presspacs/2018/acs-presspac-september-12-2018/sensors-that-are-literally-music-to-ones-ears-video.html)!

Also, check out this [Holly Ober's excellent story about mbira sensors on the UC Riverside homepage](https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2018/09/12/musical-sensor-shows-bad-medicine-plays-false-note).  Thanks Holly!

Our mbira sensors were also covered in [an article in *Popular Mechanics* by David Grossman](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a23118771/mbira-counterfeit-medicine-detector/), [a story in *New Atlas* by Ben Coxworth](https://newatlas.com/mbira-sensor/56303/), [a news item in the Royal Society of Chemistry's *Chemistry World* by Emma Stoye](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/musical-instrument-turned-into-liquid-density-sensor/3009506.article), and [a great writeup on *Ars Technica* by Chris Lee](https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/musical-instrument-goes-flat-in-presence-of-adulterated-medicine/).
