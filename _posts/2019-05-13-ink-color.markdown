Joshua Potter's paper "Using printer ink color to control the behavior of paper microfluidics" was [published in *Lab on a Chip*](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/lc/c9lc00083f).  Joshua found that different colors of Xerox ColorQube ink behave differently in paper microfluidics.  Researchers can use his findings to customize the behavior of their paper microfluidic or lateral flow devices, and even create new color-based paper microfluidic components.
