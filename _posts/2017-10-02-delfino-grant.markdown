We're delighted and grateful to be recipients of funding from the Frank G. and Janice B. Delfino Agricultural Technology Research Initiative in the College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences at UC Riverside.  We'll be working with [Prof. Hollis Woodard](http://www.woodardlab.com) of the [UCR Department of Entomology](http://entomology.ucr.edu) developing tools to accelerate research on bumblebees.  Here's an excellent [<i>New York Times</i> piece on Prof. Woodard's work](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/science/alaska-bumblebee.html).
