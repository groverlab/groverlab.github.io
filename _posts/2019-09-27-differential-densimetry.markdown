Heran Bhakta's collaboration with Christopher Hale in Prof. Victor Rodgers' lab resulted in the paper "Differential densimetry: A method for determining ultra-low fluid flux and tissue permeability," [published in *AIP Advances*](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/lc/c9lc00546c).  Chris and Heran used pairs of vibrating tube density sensors to measure extremely-small flows of fluid through biological samples.
