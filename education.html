  <img src="/assets/ngss-3d.png" width="30%" align="left" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 20px"><p>We are big proponents of the <a href="http://www.nextgenscience.org">Next Generation Science Standards</a> (NGSS).  We're especially interested the NGSS <i>Practices dimension</i>, which seeks to integrate problem-solving engineering experiences in K-12 science classes.  While engineering practices can be included in physics classes relatively easily, creating engineering practices for chemistry and biology classes can be more challenging for teachers.  We're trying to help by <b>creating technologies that support bioengineering and chemical engineering practices in K-12 schools.</b></p>
