    Hello Bioengineers,
</p>

<p>
    If you have questions about registering for classes, transfer and AP credits, breadth requirements,
    stuff like that, your Academic Advisor Cindy Loza is your best resource.  You can see
    <a href="https://student.engr.ucr.edu/academic-advisor-availability">Cindy's availability here</a>
    and also in her weekly emails, and contact her using

</p>

<p>
    I’m your Faculty Advisor, the Bioengineering professor tasked with always being available to
    discuss Bioengineering-related matters with you.  So if you’d like to discuss Bioengineering
    career stuff, internships, resumes, undergraduate research, what’s in the various
    Bioengineering classes, Senior Design project ideas, stuff like that, I’m available to help.
    Over the summer, you can reach me by email at
