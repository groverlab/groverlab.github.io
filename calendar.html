    Hello Bioengineers,
</p>

<p>
    If you have questions about registering for classes, transfer and AP credits, breadth requirements, stuff like that, your Academic Advisor Cindy Loza is your best resource.  You can see Cindy’s availability here (https://student.engr.ucr.edu/academic-advisor-availability) and also in her weekly emails, and contact her using the instructions here (https://student.engr.ucr.edu/emailing-your-academic-advisor).
</p>

<p>
    I’m your Faculty Advisor, the Bioengineering professor tasked with always being available to discuss Bioengineering-related matters with you.  So if you’d like to discuss Bioengineering career stuff, internships, resumes, undergraduate research, what’s in the various Bioengineering classes, Senior Design project ideas, stuff like that, I’m available to help.
    Over the summer, you can reach me by email at wgrover@engr.ucr.edu.
</p>
