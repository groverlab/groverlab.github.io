My oldest son's running a business selling [custom Lego sets](https://brickmoose.com), and he ships the sets using the post office's Priority Mail service.  On the off chance that you've never used it before, [Priority Mail](https://www.usps.com/ship/priority-mail.htm) uses four different standard boxes, each with a different size and shape.

Not surprisingly, the four boxes have different shipping prices, with the smallest one the cheapest at $10 and the largest one the most expensive at $25.  But perhaps more interestingly, the four boxes all have the same maximum weight:  70 pounds.

It's not hard to imagine putting 70 pounds of stuff in the largest box.  At 12 inches by 12 inches by 6 inches, its volume is half a cubic foot.   Filled with concrete, it would weigh about 75 pounds and would place you squarely in violation of the Priority Mail rules and regulations.

But what about the smallest box?  With an interior of just 8 5/8 by 5 3/8 by 1 5/8 inches, the smallest box is pretty tiny, about the size of ["three stacked DVD cases"](https://store.usps.com/store/product/shipping-supplies/priority-mail-flat-rate-small-box-P_SMALL_FRB) as the post office website helpfully suggests.  How heavy could "three DVD cases" be?  Is there any danger of exceeding the 70 pound limit?

To find out, let's first dispense with the inches and pounds and move to the metric system.  The tiny box's interior dimensions work out to about 21.9 by 13.7 by 4.1 centimeters, for a total volume of about 1230 cubic centimeters.  Our max weight of 70 pounds is about 31.8 kilograms.  Is there anything we can get our hands on that's so dense that it'll make our tiny box weigh more than 31.8 kilograms?

**Concrete** is right out.  While it was dense enough to make the large box break the weight limit, concrete is only about 2.4 grams per cubic centimeter, so filling our small box with concrete would make it only weigh about **3 kilograms**.  That's barely one tenth of the weight we need to break the limit!  Clearly we need something much more dense...

What about **lead**?  Lead's density is indeed prodigious, inspiring English idioms like "lead foot," "get the lead out," and "going over like a lead balloon."  But even at 11.3 grams per cubic centimeter, our lead-filled small box would weigh "only" about **14 kilograms** or **31 pounds**.  We're not even halfway to the maximum weight!

**Mercury** is only a little better.  With a density of 13.546 grams per cubic centimeter, a mercury-filled box would weigh about **16.7 kilograms**.  So a mercury-filled box would get you about halfway to the max weight (and potentially get you all the way to jail, since [toxic mercury is illegal to mail](https://www.usps.com/ship/shipping-restrictions.htm)).

At a whopping 19 grams per cubic centimeter, **Uranium** is extremely dense.  Depleted uranium used for armor-piercing ammunition
