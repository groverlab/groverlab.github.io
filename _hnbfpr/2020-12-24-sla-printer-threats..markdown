This is currently the top **filament-based** 3D printer on Amazon, the [$266 *Creality Ender 3 Pro* printer](https://www.amazon.com/Comgrow-Creality-Printer-Upgrade-Certified/dp/B07GYRQVYV/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=3d+printer&qid=1582575815&sr=8-3):

And this is the top **liquid-based** 3D printer on Amazon, the [$239.99 *ELEGOO Mars* printer](https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Photocuring-Printer-Off-line-Printing/dp/B07K2ZHMRF/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=3d+printer+sla&qid=1582575863&sr=8-3):

**The top liquid-based 3D printer on Amazon is actually *cheaper* than the top filament-based printer**.  This is unprecedented, and it has me worried.  Why?  

<!--more-->

**For a long time, all low-cost entry-level 3D printers were filament based.**  These printers go by a few different names, like "fused deposition modeling" (FDM) and "fused filament fabrication" (FFF), but they all work basically the same way:  the printer melts a solid plastic filament and squirts it into the shape of the printed part, which then re-solidifies as it cools.  They're kinda like a hot glue gun on steroids:

<figcaption>In a filament-based 3D printer, a solid filament (a) is melted and deposited layer-by-layer in the shape of the desired part (c).  In this process, the filament melts and re-solidifies, but it doesn't undergo any chemical reactions or change its chemical composition. </figcaption>
</figure>

These filament-based printers have some health risks associated with them, mostly associated with tiny plastic fibers that can be released into the air during operation, and fumes that can be released when some plastic filaments are heated.  But the parts and waste that filament-based printers make are pretty harmless and can even be biodegradable.  And filament-based printers were the first 3D printers to become inexpensive enough for use outside of industry.  Today, filament-based printers can be found in 

But there's another 3D printer technology that uses a liquid resin instead of a solid filament.  These printers (also called "Stereolithography" or SLA printers) use a vat of light-sensitive liquid and a light source (usually a laser) that shines on the liquid.  Wherever the laser hits the liquid, it starts a chemical reaction (photopolymerization) that turns the liquid into a solid.

These resin-based SLA printers have a lot of advantages over filament-based FDM printers - they make solid, non-porous parts that can be water-tight, transparent, tougher, and higher-resolution than FDM parts.  But for a long time, SLA printers were much more expensive than FDM printers, so they were relatively rare outside of research and industry.

But the prices for SLA printers have been dropping, and today I noticed that Amazon's top choice for an SLA printer, the ELEGOO Mars printer for $239.99, is actually cheaper than their top choice for an FDM printer, the Creality Ender 3 Pro for $266.00.  That means we're going to see many more SLA printers in homes, classrooms, libraries, makerspaces, and all the other places that we've usually just found FDM printers.

So why is this a problem?  The liquid resin used in SLA printers is much more toxic than the solid filament used in FDM printers.
