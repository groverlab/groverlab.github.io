This is currently the top **filament-based** 3D printer on Amazon, the [$266 *Creality Ender 3 Pro* printer](https://www.amazon.com/Comgrow-Creality-Printer-Upgrade-Certified/dp/B07GYRQVYV/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=3d+printer&qid=1582575815&sr=8-3):

And this is the top **liquid-based** 3D printer on Amazon, the [$239.99 *ELEGOO Mars* printer](https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Photocuring-Printer-Off-line-Printing/dp/B07K2ZHMRF/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=3d+printer+sla&qid=1582575863&sr=8-3):

**The top liquid-based 3D printer on Amazon is actually *cheaper* than the top filament-based printer**.  This is unprecedented, and it has me worried.  Why?  

<!--more-->

**For a long time, all low-cost entry-level 3D printers were filament based.**  These printers go by a few different names, like "fused deposition modeling" (FDM) and "fused filament fabrication" (FFF), but they all work basically the same way:  the printer melts a solid plastic filament and squirts it into the shape of the printed part, which then re-solidifies as it cools.  They're kinda like a robotic hot glue gun:

<figcaption>In a filament-based 3D printer, a solid filament (a) is melted and deposited layer-by-layer in the shape of the desired part (c).  In this process, the filament melts and re-solidifies, but it doesn't undergo any chemical reactions or change its chemical composition. </figcaption>

Filament-based printers were the first 3D printers to become cheap enough for use outside of industry, and today you can buy your own for just a couple hundred dollars.  That's why filament-based 3D printers became popular in classrooms, libraries, and even homes.

These filament-based printers have some health risks associated with them, mostly associated with tiny plastic fibers that can be released into the air during operation, and fumes that can be released when some plastic filaments are heated.  But the parts and waste that filament-based printers make are pretty harmless and can even be biodegradable, so their increasing popularity hasn't led to significant risks to human or environmental health.

But there's another 3D printer technology that uses a liquid resin instead of a solid filament.  These printers, called "stereolithography" (SLA) printers, use a liquid instead of a solid filament.  This liquid contains a mixture of chemical compounds that make the liquid sensitive to light.  When light shines on the liquid, the light starts a chemical reaction that turns the liquid into a solid.  By filling a tray with this liquid and shining a laser on different parts of the liquid, the 3D printer can make a solid part:

</figure>

These resin-based SLA printers have a lot of advantages over filament-based FDM printers:  they make solid, non-porous parts that can be water-tight, transparent, tougher, and higher-resolution than FDM parts.  But for a long time, SLA printers were much more expensive than FDM printers, so they were relatively rare outside of research and industry.

But the prices for SLA printers have been steadily dropping, and  I recently noticed that Amazon's top choice for a liquid-based printer is only $240, which is cheaper than their top choice for a filament-based printer.  That means we're going to see many more liquid-based printers in homes, classrooms, libraries, and all the other places that we've usually just found filament-based printers.

So why is this a problem?

The answer lies in the liquid resin used in SLA printers.
