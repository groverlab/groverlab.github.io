The top liquid-resin-based 3D printer on Amazon is now cheaper than the top filament-based 3D printer.  This has significant repercussions for human and environmental health.  Why?

For a long time, all low-cost entry-level 3D printers were filament based.  These printers (also called "Fused Deposition Modeling" or FDM printers) melt a solid plastic filament and squirt it into the shape of the printed part.  They're kinda like a hot glue gun on steroids.  They have some health risks associated with them, but the parts and waste they make are pretty harmless and can even be biodegradable.

But there's another 3D printer technology that uses a liquid resin instead of a solid filament.  These printers (also called "Stereolithography" or SLA printers) use a vat of light-sensitive liquid and a light source (usually a laser) that shines on the liquid.  Wherever the laser hits the liquid, it starts a chemical reaction (photopolymerization) that turns the liquid into a solid.

These resin-based SLA printers have a lot of advantages over filament-based FDM printers - they make solid, non-porous parts that can be water-tight, transparent, tougher, and higher-resolution than FDM parts.  But for a long time, SLA printers were much more expensive than FDM printers, so they were relatively rare outside of research and industry.

But the prices for SLA printers have been dropping, and today I noticed that Amazon's top choice for an SLA printer, the ELEGOO Mars printer for $239.99, is actually cheaper than their top choice for an FDM printer, the Creality Ender 3 Pro for $266.00.  That means we're going to see many more SLA printers in homes, classrooms, libraries, makerspaces, and all the other places that we've usually just found FDM printers.

So why is this a problem?  The liquid resin used in SLA printers is much more toxic than the solid filament used in FDM printers.
