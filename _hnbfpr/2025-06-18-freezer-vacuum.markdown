I'm a big fan of [Phyphox](https://phyphox.org), a free app for iOS and Android that lets you record raw data from your smartphone's sensors.  Smartphones have a mind-blowing array of sensors, including accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and barometers.  Some Android phones also have temperature, humidity, and proximity sensors.  I love using Phyphox to perform little experiments, like mapping out the magnetic field lines near the MRI machine at [UC Riverside's Center for Advanced Neuroimaging](https://can.ucr.edu), or measuring the rate of ascent of the [Palm Springs Aerial Tramway](https://pstramway.com) by monitoring the barometric pressure.

In case some of these little experiments might be useful for K-12 STEM teachers in their classrooms, I'll share some of them here.

Today's experiment uses my big upright freezer, which looks like this:

I started the barometer (air pressure) logger in Phyphox, then I put my iPhone inside a big upright freezer in my garage and closed the door.  I then waited for about a minute before opening the freezer door and retrieving my phone.

After exporting the barometer data from Phyphox and whipping up a quick Python program to plot it, here's what I got:

What's going on here? 

Read on for a little middle- or high-school-targeted lesson that uses this data to explore principles of gas laws, thermodynamics, and energy efficiency...
