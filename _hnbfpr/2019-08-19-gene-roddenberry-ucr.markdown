In 1972, Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek, set out to make his next big science fiction TV show.  Roddenberry's [*Genesis II*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_II_(film)) was to follow NASA scientist Dylan Hunt, who wakes up in the year 2133 to find a post-apocalyptic world fractured into various competing civilizations.

One of these civilizations, the Tyranians, wear skimpy outfits, have double navels, and live in the futuristic city of Tyrania.  And Tyrania might look familiar to some of you:

That's right, Roddenberry filmed part of the *Genesis II* pilot episode at the University of California, Riverside, in 1972.

The series didn't get picked up by CBS, so the pilot episode is all we have.  But it offers a fun look back in time at how UCR looked nearly 50 years ago.  To share this time capsule with the UCR community, I collected some of the best UCR scenes below. 

Some of the scenes show how much has changed at UC Riverside in the last 50 years.  For example, here's an early scene of Dylan Hunt (played by Alex Cord) and the Tyranian Lyra-a (Mariette Hartley) riding horses into Tyrania:

The building at the end of the clip is Pierce Hall, and the outside of Pierce hasn't changed much in 50 years (though the inside is currently undergoing a massive renovation).  Here's a comparison of Pierce in 1972 and 2019:

But that grassy and tree-studded lawn at the beginning of the clip is long gone, now replaced by the Bourns College of Engineering.  Here's my version of the same panning shot (minus the horses) in 2019:

Still lots of trees, but now Bourns Hall and the rest of the engineering complex fills what was once a grassy lawn.

Tom√°s Rivera Library appears in many scenes in Roddenberry's show, which is a bit ironic:  the building now contains the [Eaton Collection of Science Fiction and Fantasy](https://eaton.ucr.edu), one of the world's largest collections of science fiction (including many works by Roddenberry himself).  

Here are Hunt and Lyra-a walking along the arch-lined covered walkway outside the library:

And here's the same view in 2019, virtually unchanged (and a perennial selfie spot for graduation photos):
