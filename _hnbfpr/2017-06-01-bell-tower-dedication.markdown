I had so much fun making [my last animated GIF of UC Riverside history](/hnbfpr/2017-05-28-barn.html) that I made another one.  Here's the UCR Bell Tower at its dedication ceremony in 1966 and today:

The 1966 photo is from [this UCR Today article about the Bell Tower's 50th anniversary](https://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/40275).
