Phonograph records produce sound by dragging a needle along the bumpy groove in the record.  Here's a photo I took of a record under a microscope in my lab:

You can see the jagged little paths that the needle follows. But it's a little hard for me to imagine exactly how that jagged path can capture all of Verdi's opera.

Luckily, I have a special record:

This is a "test record" used to evaluate stereo equipment.  It contains a collection of standardized tones and clicks and other noises.  And while it probably never made the Billboard Top 100, it helps us understand how records work.

Here's a closeup of

This track plays A-440, the A above Middle C on the piano.  This 440 Hz note is commonly used by musicians to tune their instruments:

So now we can begin to understand how phonograph records work.  The groove is a tiny waveform of the sound.  For simple sounds like these test tones, the waveform is just a sine wave, and the groove *looks* like a sine wave.  For complex sounds like those in Verdi's *Aida*, a lot of sine waves are combined together, and the resulting record groove looks more complicated.  But it's still just a physical representation of the recorded sound wave, the pattern of pressure waves that traveled from the musicians' instruments, through the air, and to the microphone that recorded this record.  And by dragging a needle over that groove, we can recreate that pattern of pressure waves, send them through the air again, and into our ears, where the music lives again.

Let's finish with a brain teaser:  how do *stereo* records work?  Remember that stereo recordings have two channels, a Left channel and a Right channel, and they can contain different sounds; that's how you might hear a song with a singer's voice in your left ear and the band in your right ear.  In fact, a stereo record actually contains *two totally separate recordings*, but there's only one groove on the record, and one needle!  How does that work?!?

Luckily, my fancy test record has a couple tracks that are perfect for solving this question.  Here's a track that plays an 800 Hz tone in the Left channel, and 3000 Hz in the Right channel:
