The Technology Evolutionary Components Center at the University of California, Riverside works to provide students with hands-on experience engineering solutions to real-world problems, thereby preparing them for careers in the modern workforce.

Problems like climate change, disease, and hunger are difficult to tackle in part because they require multidisciplinary solutions. To help students work on these problems, we are developing the [MEC system](http://groverlab.org/research), a library of interdisciplinary "building blocks" that can be clicked together to create functional research instruments for a wide variety of different applications.

In the TEC Center, students use MECs to build, test, refine, and share tools for supporting real-world research in important fields like alternative fuels production, drug discovery, and toxicology. Since the TEC Center was founded in 2015, over 50 UC Riverside undergraduates have received an immersive training experience in the Center.
