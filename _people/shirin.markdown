Shirin is a PhD student in the Department of Bioengineering at UCR. She obtained her Bachelor's degree in Integrative Biology at the University of California, Berkeley, where she studied flow dynamics in freshwater and marine ecosystems. Before joining the Grover Lab, Shirin worked as a graduate student researcher in the Vafai Lab studying transport phenomena in porous media. Her research interests lie in developing tools for precise, real-time measurement of micro-scale pathogens and pollutants affecting our air and water systems. When not in lab, Shirin enjoys climbing rocks, biking, and planning events for the Association for Women in Science (AWIS), Inland Empire Chapter.
