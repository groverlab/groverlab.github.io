Douglas Hill graduated from the University of California, Irvine with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering, in June 1979.  Hill's first job was with Texas Instruments, where he was given the honor of being the only junior engineer awarded ‘key contributor’.  Hill then started his own system design house, Advanced Electronic Packaging Corp., solving packaging problems for many of the major corporations in the United States for over 20 years.  Currently, Hill is in the Bioengineering graduate program at the University of California, Riverside, investigating the packaging of microfluidics. Hill’s research interests include applying microfluidics in preventive medicine, and developing a FRET based system for measuring reaction kinetics.
