<p><b>Welcome to the Grover Lab at the University of California, Riverside!</b></p>

<p>We're passionate about <a href="/research"> developing instruments</a>.  Some of these instruments measure the fundamental physical properties (like mass, volume, and density) of particles and organisms.  Other instruments <i>sort</i> samples based on these properties.  Since <i>every thing</i> has these physical properties, our techniques can be applied in a wide variety of different fields, including medical diagnostics, materials science, toxicology, and many others.</p>

<p>We also create tools that accelerate the process of developing new instruments.  From software that designs microfluidic chips, to "building blocks" that can be snapped together to build functional instruments, we look forward to a day when <i>any</i> scientist can build the  tools they need quickly, easily, and inexpensively.

<p>Finally, we also believe in the importance of STEM education, and we develop <a href="/education">educational tools</a> that help students include engineering practices in their science classes.</p>
