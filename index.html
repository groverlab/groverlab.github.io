<h2>Welcome to the Grover Lab at the University of California, Riverside</h2>

<p>We're passionate about <a href="/research"> developing instruments</a>.  Some of these instruments <a href="/research/2017-04-05-vibrating-tube-sensors.html">measure the fundamental physical properties (like mass, volume, and density) of particles and organisms</a>.  Other instruments we're working on can <i>sort</i> samples based on these properties.  Since <i>every thing</i> has these physical properties, our techniques can be applied in a wide variety of different fields, including medical diagnostics, materials science, toxicology, and many others.</p>

<p>We also create tools that accelerate the process of developing new instruments.  From <a href="/research/2016-09-28-random-microfluidics.html">software that designs microfluidic chips automatically</a>, to <a href="/research/2016-06-21-mec.html">"building blocks" that can be snapped together to build functional instruments</a>, we look forward to the day when <i>any</i> scientist can build the  tools they need quickly, easily, and inexpensively.

<p>Finally, we also believe in the importance of engineering in science education, and we develop <a href="/education">educational tools</a> that help students include engineering practices in their science classes.</p>
