William H. Grover
-----------------

Dr. Grover is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of California, Riverside.  Prior to joining UCR, Dr. Grover received his postdoctoral training in the Biological Engineering Division at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  In Prof. Scott Manalis’ group at MIT, Dr. Grover used the group’s microfluidic mass sensors to make the first precision measurements of the density of single living cells.  Dr. Grover obtained his Ph.D. in Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley.  In Prof. Richard Mathies' group at UC Berkeley, Dr. Grover developed microfluidic “processors” that bridged the chemical, biological, and computational sciences.  A native of Tennessee, Dr. Grover received his B.S. in Chemistry at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.  You can follow his random musings on Twitter.


Brittney McKenzie
-----------------

Brittney is a PhD Student in the Department of Bioengineering at UCR. She earned her B.S. in Bioengineering and minor in Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington in 2013. Before joining the Grover Lab, Brittney spent a year and a half as an undergraduate researcher in Dr. Elain Fu's lab with a focus in paper microfluidic device and tool development for low-cost diagnostic applications. While in the Fu Lab, she developed a new method of sequencing fluids in paper devices and co-authored a publication on this research. Her current research interests are in developing tools and microdevices for diagnostic applications.
