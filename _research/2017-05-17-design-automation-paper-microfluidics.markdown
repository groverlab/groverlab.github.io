This paper introduces a novel software framework to support automated development of paper-based microfluidic devices. Compared to existing lab-on-a-chip technologies, paper-based microfluidics differs in terms of substrate technologies and point-of-care usage across a wide variety environmental conditions. This paper addresses the contexts in which the software can address these challenges and presents several initial case studies that demonstrate the capabilities of the framework to produce workable and usable paper microfluidic devices.
