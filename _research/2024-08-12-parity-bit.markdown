Pneumatic control systems are common in manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, robotics, and many other fields. Undetected failures in pneumatic systems can have serious consequences. In this work, we present an air-powered error detector that can identify failures in pneumatic systems. This device contains a pneumatic logic circuit of 21 microfluidic valves that calculates the parity bit corresponding to several pneumatic control bits. If a problem such as an air leak or blockage occurs, then the calculated and expected parity bits will not match, and the device outputs an error signal to alert the user or to shut down the system. As a proof of concept, we used the device to detect anomalies in an intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) medical device. By providing a simple and low-cost way to detect problems without using sensors, the pneumatic error detector can promote safety and reliability across a wide range of pneumatic systems.
